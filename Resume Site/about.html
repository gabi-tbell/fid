My family members either worked in the tech industry or pursued creative passions such as music and art.<br><br>It was no surprise then, that I found myself drawn to the world of digital media. In middle school, I tinkered with coding and web design, and as I grew older, I enrolled in more focused classes.

As I learned to navigate the complex world of graphics, photography, and content creation, there were times when I felt overwhelmed. But every setback has only served to fuel my determination to master my craft.<br><br>And I know that my skills will continue to evolve. After all, the world of digital media is constantly changing and evolving, just like the tech landscape of my hometown. But that excites me - the potential to create something new, explore new mediums and platforms, and continue to grow as both a digital artist and a person.<br><br>As I look to the future, I know that the world of digital media is where I belong. And I can&#x27;t wait to see where this journey takes me next. </p>
